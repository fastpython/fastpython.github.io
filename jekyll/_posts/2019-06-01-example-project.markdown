For testing purposes there's a simple project that helps you to setup and test few different Python frameworks. It includes simple _"Hello"_ REST API end-point that we'll use for testing.

You'll find the code in Github [fastpython/benchmark-web-frameworks]().

There are simple test projects for:

- [Django](https://github.com/django/django)
- [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask)
- [Sanic](https://github.com/huge-success/sanic)
- [aiohttp](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp)

Django and Flask are both good for different purposes and as a comparison there are some that support `async/await`.
