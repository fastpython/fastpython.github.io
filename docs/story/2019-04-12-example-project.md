For testing purposes there's a simple project that helps you to setup and test few different Python frameworks. It includes simple _"Hello"_ REST API end-point that we'll use for testing.

You'll find the code in Github <a href="https://github.com/fastpython/benchmark-web-frameworks" target="_blank">benchmark-web-frameworks</a>.

There are simple test projects for:

- <a href="https://github.com/django/django" target="_blank">Django</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask" target="_blank">Flask</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/huge-success/sanic" target="_blank">Sanic</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp" target="_blank">aiohttp</a>

Django and Flask are both good for different purposes and as a comparison there are some that support `async/await`. More to be added when there are interesting development steps happening.
