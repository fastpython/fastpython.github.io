# The Fast Python

This is a blog or a collection of notes that help Python developers to profile and optimize their code better - to make code faster. Or, if not help to make code any faster, at least points you to all interesting and helpful stuff that is out there to ease your way on faster Python code.

## The Story of Fast Python

While this is a blog and posts are not in any particular order, some posts are related. Therefore, there's also a [Story](/story/). Story guides you through what I think is a good order for reading the posts. Story is never finished. When new posts are added, they are added to story in right places. 

If you know what you are doing, just jump into posts you feel are interesting. If you are not sure where to start when facing Python performance issues, start from the [Story](/story/).


## As easy as `import antigravity`

While the blog is concentrating on web development challenges, the fast Python code is fast also in other contex. Often people say that speed that Python gives you is more about "speed on implementing new features". That's of course right, but it's not just that. 

If you know what is the actual bottle neck of you application and why is something too slow, there's often something you can do about it. Something that'll make your Python app [fly](https://xkcd.com/353/) a bit better.

You just need to know how to figure out what's wrong. And then, how to move from there.


## Something is missing?

If you feel that should be include in _"this is what you need to write faster Python code"_, please let me know.
