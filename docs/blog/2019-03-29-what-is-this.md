# What is this

The Fast Python is a blog or more of a collection of notes that helps Python developers to profile and optimize their code right - to make code faster.

If you do it right, Python will make your app fly as xkcd puts it. You can however also make your Python code unnecessarily slow. Even if you don't try. If that's the case then you'll be in this situation.


## The Problem

It all started with API problems. That's the normal case where "some slowness" is reported by customers. Depending on the company it might be a long way or a short way but eventually the knowledge of something being slow ends up to developers.

> <span style="color: #872215;"> \[customer\]: Your app is slow. Fix it! </span>
>
> <span style="color: #0e103a;"> \[dev\]: Hmm.. this API end-points indeed feels kind of slow. Yes, it's slow-ish. Noo, it's awfully slow.. </span>

Luckily in this case we have a Guru to help us.

> 
> <span style="color: #15873f;"> \[guru\]: Slow down. What code are we making faster here? </span>
> 
> <span style="color: #0e103a;"> \[dev\]: Well, one of my API end-points feels kind of slow. I'm using this one Python framework.. which is awesome btw. </span>

On other words, this blog is a collection of lessons learned while figuring out why one of the web apps of the Internet was too slow.
