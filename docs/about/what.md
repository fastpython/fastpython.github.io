# What is this?

Fast Python blog is about what to keep in mind when you need to make your Python code fast. Blog is concentrating on web development challenges, but fast Python code is fast also in other contex.

This "fast Python code" is not a new topic. On contrary, it's covered in different forms already millions of times. All Python developers need to touch the topic at some point which results small bits of knowledge scattered everywhere.

> So, why to write more about it? 

Well, this started as my own list of notes when I tried to gather information on what makes Python code fast. Then I was writing it as a reference material in company I work in. And, finally, I thought that better just publish it, since no harm done and somebody else might benefit of it also.

Technically, this is my own notes, but just made public.


## The content

Content of the blog comes is notes and lessons learned while developing software with Python mainly in web context. Making slow-ish code faster is something that all Python developer do sooner or later. The content is from one of those paths. 

That said, there are some topics that are not that much related to "making Python code performance better", but are just topics I wanted to write about.


## The source

So, where's the content of the blog coming from? All over the place and from some lessons learned. There are plenty of good books about Python, internet is full of good articles and, finally, by just developing you'll learn what makes Python code faster. I'll try to always refer where to find more information on any topic that I'll cover. 

This "fast Python" is a topic that is covered already millions of times - and will be covered until some better language replace Python. 

Content of the blog is also a collection of what is available and state of the current situtation.
